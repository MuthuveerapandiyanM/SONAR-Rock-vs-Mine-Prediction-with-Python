# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-with-Python

### Logistic Regression Problem

The SONAR Rock vs. Mine Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model using logistic regression to distinguish between rocks and mines based on SONAR signals. This project utilizes Python programming and the scikit-learn library to implement and train the logistic regression model.

The main objective of this project is to accurately predict whether a given SONAR signal represents a rock or a mine. By analyzing the SONAR data and training a logistic regression model, the project aims to achieve a high level of accuracy in classification.
